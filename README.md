# Mini-IDE (Enhanced Java Text Editor)

A lightweight and functional Mini-IDE built using Java (Swing). This project takes a basic open-source text editor and upgrades it with essential development features like code execution, multi-tab support, and crash protection.

## 🚀 Key Features (New Upgrades)

To transform this from a simple notepad into a developer tool, I implemented the following major features:

### 1. Built-in Code Runner ▶️
- **Supports:** Java, C++, and Python.
- **Functionality:** Compile and run code directly within the editor. The output is displayed in a built-in console window, eliminating the need for the command line.

### 2. Multi-Tabbed Interface 📑
- **Productivity:** Open and edit multiple files simultaneously.
- **Switching:** seamless switching between tabs (e.g., editing a main program and a data file at the same time).

### 3. Auto-Save System 💾
- **Safety:** Automatically saves every open file **every 10 seconds** in the background.
- **Crash Protection:** Prevents data loss in case of unexpected shutdowns or crashes.

### 4. Status Bar Feedback ✅
- **Visual Assurance:** Displays real-time status updates (e.g., *"Saved successfully at 10:30 AM"*), ensuring the user knows their actions were processed.

1. **Download:** Go to the file list or the `dist/` folder and download **`mini-IDE-by_Naz.jar`**.
2. **Run:** Double-click the JAR file. 
   - *Note:* If it doesn't open, ensure Java is installed.
   - Alternatively, run via command line:
